This is our ChangeLog so we can note what changes we did and if there's any issues can backtrack, this was started after the GUI was made and 
A* was implemented.
Format: Change (i, j): User - Changemade
Where (i , j) = the j'th change made during the i'th change.

Change (1, 1): Eli - Stopped Player.Move() from moving the player off the map.
Change (1, 2): Eli - Fixxed actions not being drawn while the location they'd send the player too is still on the map.
Change (1, 3): Eli - Fixxed PathCounter being set to 0 instead of -1 when finished pathing, not that it matters since currently
		I don't know a way of pathing again unless I make a second Path function that does the EXACT same thing except
		only runs when DonePathingTwo is false, and DonePathingTwo is tehn set to false when DonePathing is set to true so
		it begins the next path, actually we could use the same function for that we just replace the DonePathing boolean
		with an array so that when the path that is doing DonePathing[0] is done and it sets DonePathing[0] to true (the
		rest are all true atm as they're not pathign yet, so maybe change the name of DonePathing to NotPathing) then it'll
		set DonePathing[1] to false so that the next input starts pathing, I should be able to implement that.
Change (1, 4): Eli - Added the ability to path multiple times in one run.
Change (1, 5): Eli - Switched to map seven and created a small maze as map seven, switched target input.
Change (1, 6): Eli - For AStar.cpp switched the overloaded operator < for coordinate to return lhs.x < rhs.x || (lhs.x == rhs.x && lhs.y < rhs.y); instead of
		     return lhs.x + rhs.x < lhs.y + rhs.y.
